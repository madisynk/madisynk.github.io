# Introduction
Hello, I am Madisyn Kuczenski. Throughout my learning experience while obtaining a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science with a concentration in data analysis, I have gained many new skills. Becoming proficient in coding with many different languages, communicating to stakeholders, and data analysis are some of the many abilities I have grown very familiar with. This ePortfolio is a reflection of my best work and the skillset I have. 

# Reflection of Skills
Throughout my time in the computer science program, I have been able to learn about and try out many different subjects. I started by learning very basic concepts in Python, Java, and C++ languages. From there, I began to work on more advanced projects in each language. Some of the projects brought out my strengths, as they came very easily to me, and I was able to go above and beyond what was expected. For example, when creating projects with Python, I was able to complete them quickly as the language was easy for me to remember the syntax. Additionally, I took some courses that focused on using coding to help with data analysis. This is where I found my true passion, as I was eager to complete the coursework and learn as much as possible. Working with SQL databases was very interesting, and I enjoyed querying the database to complete the projects. Thanks to opportunities and knowledge I have gained throughout the program, it has made me prepared to enter the computer science workforce. 

### Collaborating in a Team Environment
I have learned how to collaborate in a team environment while completing the computer science program. There have been courses that I have taken where the main focus of the class was not coding, but how to convey my ideas to others in a team, as well as take their ideas into consideration. I understand the importance of teamwork and working cohesively within a team. By using concepts like SCRUM and Kanban, I have practiced and become skillful in working with in a team environment.

### Communicating with Stakeholders
Communicating with stakeholders is another important concept that this program has allowed me to become skilled in. I have learned how to express the ideas of a project without using technical terminology, as many stakeholders are not well versed in complex computer science syntax. Additionally, I have practiced updating the ideas and plans put into place when a stakeholder requests a change. It is important to be able to change course when necessary while still keeping a professional manner. 

### Data Structures and Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms are a computer science topic that is vital to understand. Data structures involve organizing and holding data, while data algorithms are steps taken to solve problems or complete a task. Using a SQL database to store information has been one of my most worked on skills in this category, along with implementing solutions to make sure that the code is working as intended. By creating neat, organized data structures and high-quality data algorithms, I can allow for the project to be trusted and efficient. 

### Software Engineering and Design
Software engineering and design are valuable as the skills allow me to create new projects from scratch. I have taken full stack development classes that helped me learn how to build a program from the start to the end, creating both a user-facing design and an admin page. Creating the design of a project, like how it should look and what the functionality of it will be, as well as writing the code to make the ideas come to be are skills that have been helpful for me to gain throughout this program. 

### Databases
Working with databases has been my favorite skill to learn throughout the computer science program. I have learned how to build a database, query the database, add new information, modify or remove information, and use the database to figure out trends. Working with both SQL and NoSQL databases has allowed me to learn different ways to store information and find what data is needed. 

### Security
Security is an extremely important skill that has been taught to me. I understand the importance of working with sensitive information and making sure that no one else has access to the data. Implementing security features like admin privileges, encryption, and the principle of least privilege is highly crucial. Also, input validation is important to make sure that hackers cannot gain control of programs. I have become well-versed in the different security options and am able to implement them

# Introduction to Artifacts 
The artifact that I have chosen to demonstrate my skills is from the CS-340 Client/Server Development course. The artifact was originally created to use CRUD operations to take in data of rescue animals to be implemented into an animal shelter database. A client facing webpage was created to showcase the different entries in the database, allowing the user to filter the results based on the different type of rescue animals, where they are located, and what type of breeds were most popular for different types of rescues. 
I chose this artifact to showcase my ability in the 3 different computer science categories, as it had many different features already that could be improved upon to make a better overall project. I worked on translating the artifact into a different coding language, implementing a more secure data validation check, and upgrading the database to more advanced SQL queries. Throughout the process of implementing the enhancements, I was able to reflect on my past skills and the new knowledge that I have learned from continuing my education. Computer science is a field that requires constant learning, and I have proven to be dedicated to learn new skills by the work that I have completed.
